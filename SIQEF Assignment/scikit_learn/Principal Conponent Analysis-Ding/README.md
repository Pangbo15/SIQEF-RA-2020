# Time Series Analysis

Author: DING Xiangyu

In this part, I learned the algorithm of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and gave two cases of applying PCA to actual data.

Scikit-learn (sklearn) contains a toolbox for PCA, and I used it to conduct analysis on two cases: data of breast cancer in Wisconsin, and import and export structure data of China and its 18 major trade partners in 2016.

In order to understand the PCA algorithm, I learnt the mathematics of PCA through Wikipedia. After that I wrote a program that can be used to do PCA in the algorithm section. I tested the function using data of breast cancer, and the result showed that the function gave same results as the sklearn PCA toolbox.

Please retrieve the Jupyter notebook that he presents and experiment with it. I would like to use some
of his explanations to create a notebook about that with some examples that you create with both artificial data and perhaps some actual data.
